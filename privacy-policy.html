                <p>We implement technical and organizational measures to protect your information, including encryption in transit and at rest provided by Supabase, and secure authentication via one-time magic links. However, data stored within Supabase can be viewed by authorized administrators, and the Service does not currently use end-to-end encryption for user content.</p>
                <p>While we strive to protect your data, no method of transmission or storage is completely secure.</p>

                <h2>7. Children's Privacy</h2>
                <p>Kerido is not intended for children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal data from children, and we do not have technical means to verify a user's age. If you believe that a child has provided us with personal data, please contact <a href="mailto:killian.frailey@kerido.co">killian.frailey@kerido.co</a> so we can delete it.</p>

                <h2>8. International Data Transfers</h2>
                <p>Your data may be stored or processed in the United States or other countries where we or our service providers operate. We take steps to ensure adequate protection consistent with applicable privacy laws.</p>

                <h2>9. Changes to This Policy</h2>
